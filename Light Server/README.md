# Light Server

In this program, the "lightserver" server listens for messages coming from a client regarding an imaginary lightswitch, and the client 
will tell the server to turn the light on or off (based on the message it sends).

The remaining scripts demonstrate how the server handles unknown commands and mismatched client/server versions.
